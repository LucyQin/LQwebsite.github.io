    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Several years ago I developed a deep affection towards peach blossom (probably because of A Tale of the Fountain of the Peach Blossom Spring &amp; Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land). This spring I paid a visit to Linzhi, Tibet, a paradise for my partiality. March.24Tibet is one of the most dangerous destinations in China. For security I chose (if not forced by my parents) to travel with a small tour group. My friend Shi accompanied me. Unlike most rural places in Northwestern China, Linzhi offered us hungry tourists abundant chicken, instead of beef or lamb. Shi and I enjoyed an incredibly delicious specialty “Stone Pot Chicken” at a local restaurant. Our hotel was near Yarlung Zangbo River. On the balcony I could gaze afar at the river and a serene backdrop of continuous mountains. March.25The next day we headed to Gala Peach Blossom Village. On our way I saw a flock of sheep (so lovely!). Tibetan peach is distinct from commonly seen peach species. Native to the foothills of the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas, the trees yield small fruit but big flowers. Every year, the whole blossom season lasts from mid-March to mid-April; Gala Village enjoys the earliest full blooming. By the time we arrived, the village has already been immerged in a sea of peach flowers. We departed at noon. The bus took us over Segrila Mountain to Lulangzhen for lunch. Later that day we arrived at Bakacun. Looking outside from our cottage, I was again endowed tranquil scenery. March.26In the morning we made peach blossom wine. (Don’t be fooled by this name. The wine was not made of peach flowers; it’s merely made in the season when peach trees bloom.) Afterwards we had a short walk in nearby mountain areas. (The place was like somewhere in Northern Europe.) In the afternoon, the bus carried us around to where the flowers bloomed well. We shot dozens of nice photos that day. March.27We returned following the same path we came, crossing Segrila Mountain for the second time. This time we stayed on the mountain longer, and thus were able to take a close look at sutra streamers (also known as “wind horse flag”). These colorful flags and papers are Tibetan people’s messages to the Gods of Nature. Among the five colors, yellow stands for ground, red for fire, blue for sky; green for river, white for pure heart. From the mountain we could look down at Lulang Forest Sea (still covered in snow). March.28It was a bright sunny day. We were fortunate enough to have a full, clear vision of Namcha Barwa. (More often that not, clouds would gather above the peak.) Rising about 7,782 meters above sea level, Namcha Barwa ranks as the 28th highest peak in the world. Then we drove back to Linzhi, where we had an authentic Tibetan dinner. March.29On the last day, we got to Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet Autonomous Region. Located in the old area of Lhasa City, Barkhor Street is a very ancient round street surrounding the Jokhang Temple. Walking in the street, we saw many pilgrims hoding the prayer wheels. To express their piety, some pilgrims even progressed body-length by body-length (i.e. incessantly fell down upon their knees). In front of the Jokhang Temple, there were even more people worshipping. Finally we had a glimpse of Potala Palace from the outside square. If you’re wondering how the reflection was achieved: Book Sharing The Struggle for Modern Tibet: The Autobiography of Tashi Tsering, by Tashi Tsering, Melvyn C. GoldsteinTashi’s stories took place in mid-to-late 20th century. Born in a small Tibetan village, Tashi seized opportunities to first travel to Lhasa (to dance for Dalai Lama), then to India (when Dalai Lama’s regime failed), then to the U.S. (studying at Williams College &amp; University of Washington!), and finally back to China (during Cultural Revolution). Throughout all these twists and turns, Tashi’s commitment to education and revolution is never changed. He inspires his readers to make local progress one step at a time, to construct a better future society.]]></content>
